            As you didn’t understand some or all of the terms in the knowledge
            check, we sadly can’t take your application forward right now. You
            can still apply for a With Profits ISA via a Wesleyan Financial
            Services Consultant (initial advice fee of 3% will apply), or you
            can re-apply online when you’re more familiar with the terms.
